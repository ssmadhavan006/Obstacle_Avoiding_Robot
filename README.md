# ðŸ¤– Obstacle Avoiding Robot with Arduino + Ultrasonic Sensor + L298N

An autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot built using Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and an L298N motor driver. It detects obstacles using sound waves and intelligently navigates its environment.

## ðŸ›  Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- 2x DC Motors + Wheels
- Servo Motor (optional)
- AAA Battery Pack
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The ultrasonic sensor sends a pulse.
2. It calculates the distance by measuring the echo time.
3. If distance > 10 cm â†’ robot moves forward.
4. If an obstacle is closer:
   - It moves backward.
   - Rotates to the right.
   - Continues checking until the path is clear.
   - Moves forward again.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Connect all components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the sketch:
   - ðŸ‘‰ [`obstacle_avoiding_robot.ino`](./obstacle_avoiding_robot.ino)
3. Power the robot with the battery pack.
4. Watch it navigate autonomously!
